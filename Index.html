				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a first semester senior from Nevada, Iowa.  My major is Business Analytics, but I am taking both tracks of the BAIS program.  I'm 23 years old; I'm a little older than everyone else because I transferred from Iowa State, took a year off, and switched majors.  My main interests are sports and technology.  My favorite sport is basketball, and my NBA team: the Minnesota Timberwolves, they are just terrible!  As for technology, I'm really interested in the open source development model.  I'm excited about android, though I currently own an iPhone (which I very much regret), and hope to learn to develop mobile apps some day. </p>
				<h2>Academic/Career Info</h2>
				<p>As stated earlier, I'm a BAIS major taking both tracks.  After graduation I hope to enter the industry in an IT consulting or software development role.  This summer I'm taking a good step towards my goals by working as a business/systems analyst intern for State Farm in Bloomington, IL. Someday I hope to return to Iowa to earn an MBA. </p>
